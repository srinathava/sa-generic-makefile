Example project using the generic Makefile
==========================================

This directory illustrates a simple way to use the generic Makefile. It
also illustrates how you can actually modify the parameters of the generic
Makefile without modifying the generic Makefile itself. In this case, we
have over-ridden the program name to "foo" instead of the default "test".
